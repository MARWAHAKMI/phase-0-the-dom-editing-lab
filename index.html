    <h1>My HTML adventure</h1>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
        the industry's standard dummy text
        ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
        book. It
        has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        <em>essentially</em>
        unchanged. It
        was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
        recently with
        desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
